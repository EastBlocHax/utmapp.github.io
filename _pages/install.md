UTM does not require a jailbreak to use, but you must sideload it. If you are new to sideloading, it is a way to use a developer's certificate to load unapproved apps on a non-jailbroken iOS device. There are a few limitations to sideloading:

* Free developer accounts must re-sign every 7 days
* Paid developer accounts must re-sign every 1 year
* iOS 13.3.1 broke the ability to sign with free accounts, so stay on <= 13.3 if you have not updated

## Download

[You can download the latest unsigned IPA release from Github.][1]

## Signing

A free and easy way to re-sign an IPA is with [iOS App Signer][2]. There are also various "cloud signing" services and "uuid registration" services that allow you to sign IPAs at a fraction of the cost of a paid developer account.
